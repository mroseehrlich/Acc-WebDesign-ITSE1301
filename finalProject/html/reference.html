                            Module 1 covers the basics of html which I used on every page of my site. Examples of this are 
                            sectioning elements, navigation lists, links, and grouping elements.

                            Module 2 is a basic introduction to CSS. It covers stylesheets, styles specificity, precedence, and 
                            inheritance, margin and padding, color, and font styles. I used all these concepts on each page of my 
                            site.

                            Module 3 covers reset stylesheets, layout designs, width and heights, centering content, floated content, 
                            grid layouts, positioning, and overflow. I used most of these concepts throughout my site. I specifically 
                            used CSS grid on my <a href="menu.html">menu page</a> and relative and absolute positioning on the images on my homepage.

                        <p class="reference-paragraph">
                            Module 4 covered figure boxes, background styles, borders, drop shadows, transformations, perspective, 
                            color gradients, semi-transparent objects, CSS filters, and image maps. I used quite a bit from this 
                            chapter in order to design my site: I used a linear gradient background on the main container for my page 
                            content on all pages; I used a CSS filter for contrast on an <a href="#home_img5">image</a> on my homepage; text shadows are used on 
                            all page headings for each page and links in the footer, and drop shadows were used on the main body container 
                            and all images on the site.

                        <p class="reference-paragraph">
                            Module 5 introduces mobile web design, including media queries, pulldown menus, CSS flexbox, navicon menus, 
                            print media queries, the @page rule, and working with page breaks. I used very rudimentary flex styles for 
                            spacing layout in the footer and used media queries to adjust page content at various page breaks determined 
                            by page width. I originally styled the page for desktop first, though if I would design mobile first if I were 
                            to work out the design again.

                                Module 6 introduced web tables and all aspects of designing with them. I did not use table content in my website.

                            Module 7 covered web forms, including field sets, input types, labels, form layout, buttons, and validation. I 
                            used a form on my <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> that, were it coupled with JavaScript and server-side functionality, could be used 
                            to send an email to the business for whom the site was designed.

                            Module 8 introduced web multimedia. It covered audio and video as well as animation and transitions. I 
                            used transitions on transformations applied to the hover pseudoclasses on the images on my homepage as 
                            well as on links throughout the site.
